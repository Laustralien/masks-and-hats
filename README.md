# Masks and Hats

### Intro
This is a toolkit for making silly (or not silly) masks and hats and put them on people's faces. All digitally. There is two scripts, `create_mask.py` and `apply_mask.py`. 
<br><br>Below is the [logic of the script]() explained, some [example commands]() and some [help for installing the dependencies](): OpenCV, dlib and Stasm (as tested on OSX). 
<br><br>**Thanks** to [Sam Lavigne](https://github.com/antiboredom) on whose code the `create_mask.py` entirely relies. [His repo](https://github.com/antiboredom/mask-generator) is found slightly modified in the mask_generator directory of this project. 
<br>The foundation of the other script, `apply_mask.py` is [this tutorial](http://www.learnopencv.com/face-morph-using-opencv-cpp-python/). 
<br><br>Please also check out [previous explorations](http://leoneckert.com/projects/anonymizme/) of mine in which I mainly had fun with replacing faces with *visually similar* ones as retrieved from search engines in real time.
